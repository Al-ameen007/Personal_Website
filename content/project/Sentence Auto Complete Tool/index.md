This project downloads and processes the Enron Sentiment Dataset using natural language processing techniques. The dataset is extracted and processed with NLTK, where tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization are applied to prepare the text for analysis. Stop words are removed from the dataset, ensuring that only relevant tokens are kept. The processed data is intended for further sentiment analysis or machine learning applications.
