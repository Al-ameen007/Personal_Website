# EEG-Motor-Imagery-Classification
This project focuses on classifying EEG signals from motor imagery tasks (right-hand and left-hand movements) using machine learning. The data is preprocessed, segmented into trials, and features are extracted through Fourier transforms to analyze the frequency domain. A neural network and a Random Forest classifier are trained to distinguish between the two motor imagery tasks using cross-validation. The results demonstrate the ability to classify motor imagery signals based on their spectral characteristics.
