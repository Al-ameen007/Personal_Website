# Thermonuclear-Supernova-Classification
This project explores the classification of thermonuclear supernovae based on observable and physical parameters using multi-wavelength signatures. Data visualization techniques, such as correlation matrices and parallel coordinate plots, are used to analyze relationships between parameters like tao, vmax, and Î¦300. Strong correlations between certain parameters and the need for data scaling are identified. The insights gained from these analyses form the basis for developing future classification models.
