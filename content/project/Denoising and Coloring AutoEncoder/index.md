# Denoising-and-Coloring-Autoencoder
This project implements autoencoders for two image processing tasks: colorizing grayscale images and denoising noisy images. The colorization model learns to predict color channels for black-and-white images, while the denoising model removes noise from corrupted images. Both tasks leverage deep learning techniques using TensorFlow and Keras. The project demonstrates how autoencoders can effectively reconstruct and enhance images.
